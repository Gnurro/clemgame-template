Let's play a game. You must have a conversation about $topic with your partner. Their first turn must start and end with words that begin with the letter $letter. Your reply must be similar, with the letter that comes after $letter in the alphabet. Then it's their turn again with the next letter, and so on. You'll do it for $n_turns turns. Always start your utterance with I SAY: and then give your answer. Do not state that you understood the rules or add that you are waiting for your partner's response. If you break the rules, you lose.
